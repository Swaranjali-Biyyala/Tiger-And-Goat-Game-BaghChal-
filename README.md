# Tiger-And-Goat-Game-BaghChal-
The Tiger and Goat game project aims to create a text-based implementation of the traditional two-player strategy board game, also known as Bagh-Chal or Aadu Puli Aatam, using the Python programming language. The game will be played in the console, providing a simple and enjoyable gaming experience.

Features:

Game Board:

The game will be played on a 5x5 grid representing the playing board.
The grid will consist of 25 intersection points where the game pieces can be placed.
Player Roles:

The game will have two players: the Tiger player and the Goat player.
The Tiger player will have 4 tiger pieces, while the Goat player will have 20 goat pieces.
Initial Placement:

At the beginning of the game, the Tiger player will place their four tiger pieces on any vacant intersection points.
The Goat player will then place their twenty goat pieces on the remaining vacant intersection points.
Game Rules:

The Tiger player starts first and can move one of their tiger pieces to an adjacent vacant intersection point.
The Goat player then moves one of their goat pieces to any adjacent vacant intersection point.
Tigers can capture goats by jumping over them in a straight line to an adjacent vacant intersection point, removing the captured goat from the board.
Goats cannot capture tigers and can only move to adjacent vacant intersection points.
Tigers win the game by capturing all goats, while goats win by blocking all tiger's legal moves.
Game Logic:

The game logic will be implemented using Python classes and functions.
The board state will be represented using a 2D list or an appropriate data structure.
The game will continuously prompt the players for their moves and update the board accordingly.
Validations will be implemented to ensure players' moves are legal and within the game rules.
User Interface:

The game will be played in the console, displaying the current state of the game board after each move.
The players' moves and prompts will be displayed clearly to guide the players during the game.
End of Game:

The game will determine the winner based on the game rules.
Once the game is over, the program will display the winner and give players the option to play again or exit.
Overall, this Tiger and Goat game project using Python will provide a command-line interface for players to enjoy the classic board game and showcase their strategic skills.
